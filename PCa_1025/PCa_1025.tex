Questions:
1. What, typically, is the weakest usability metric of the menus/forms/dialogs interaction style, and why?
2. Name a feature that can be included in a menus/forms/dialogs user interface that addresses this metric.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Memorability is the weakest usability metric of the menus/forms/dialogs interaction style, because these rely on recognition instead of recall. In other words, these interaction styles attempt to make a system that is easily recognizable by new users and old, while the memorability is an afterthought.

\item 
Symbols or icons within menus are examples of a system's memorability. Most people think of the homepage when they see a Home button in a menu, which makes that icon memorable to the user. 
\end{enumerate}
