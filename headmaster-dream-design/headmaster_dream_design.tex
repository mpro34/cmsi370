My idea for a dream headmaster interface starts with the headmaster login page. When the login page is opened in a browser, it will show the standard "Welcome to Headmaster" title, user id, and password. However, login screen background will consist of an animated world, which is customizable once logged into headmaster.

As soon as the login button is pressed, the login credentials will fade away and the screen will zoom into a town consisting of four big buildings, a space shuttle, a small building with a metal cog as its front store sign, and a lot of animated people walking around the town. This is similar to The Sims games where the virtual people are arbitrarily walking around. To expand, the first building looks like a school and has a giant S on the front of the building, representing students. The second building has a giant letter E as the front building sign, which represents events. The thrid building looks like a bank and has a big G at the front, standing for grants. The fourth big building, representing reports, has a R at the front of it. The small building with the metal cog represents the settings for the webpage, where the login page background can be slightly customized.

 The top of the webpage has a medium search bar, where the user may search for anything within headmaster, for example a student, events, grants, and/or reports. If the user is lazy and has no desire to use the keyboard, a voice command may also be issued by pressing a microphone icon next to the search bar. This feature is similar to Apple's Siri technology. 

An alternative, more satisfying way to search for students, grants, etc. is provided within this webpage as well. As a user mouses over any of the 6 items or buildings described above, they become illumniated and each respective building reveals its purpose. 

The S building cooresponds to the students tab on the headmaster webpage. When this building is clicked, my headmaster webpage will zoom in from the overall town view to into the building. Inside the S building consists of five doors which are again highlighted once the user puts his/her mouse over them. The doors consist of titles which are 'Freshman', 'Sophomores', 'Juniors', 'Seniors', and 'Create'. Similar to the town view above, a search bar is displayed at the top of the S building screen which allows the user to search for a individual student. Once the user enters any of the four doors, except the Create door, a view of a hallway with virutal people is displayed. The names of each person is displayed above their respective heads and the user may quickly go up and down the hallway via scrolling or the up and down arrow keys. 

Once a student is pressed a separate screen with the selected student standing and slighting moving around, like the Nintendo Wii avatars, and a menu of student properties is displayed on the right. The student properties consist of Grades, Grants, Information, Food Allergies, etc and an Edit button. The Edit button may be pressed, which only changes the student properties page from non-editable to editable, while the avatar remains in the same place. Back arrows on the upper left of each screen within any of the S, H, G, etc. buildings will be displayed bringing the user back to the previous page. However, the user could always press the web browsers back button as well.

The S, E, G, and R buildings all have similar inside setups. The E building differs from the S building where instead of having students in the hallway, there are floating sports items, like basketballs. Which signify events and can be edited through the same method as the student edit operation described above. The G building holds floating scrolls instead of students, which represent grants. Clicking on a scroll will bring up a separate screen with the grant and its information. The building with the R contains
